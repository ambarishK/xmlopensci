# Raising Issues

Github has an [Issues facility](issues) where you can post issues such as:
* bugs
* requests for help
* tasks to be done

Issues can be tagged with their role (prority, bug, etc.). Issues can be closed and re-opened.

There is no shame in posting.

Issues are dealt with as and when people have time. A large number of Open issues is not a criticism of a project, just that 
it's a challenging one. We have had 100 issues on the Tigr2ess project.
