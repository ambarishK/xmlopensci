XML Tools and resources for Open Science.
A personal selection of tools I find most useful

## scientific background
A distributed group of open scientists are mining the literature for knowledge relevant to global problems. the discussion is concentrated at [openNoteBook](https://github.com/petermr/opennotebook) and the domain-specific ([climate change](https://github.com/petermr/climate) and [plant chemistry for medicine, CEV](https://github.com/petermr/plants)). The original material from [EPMC](http://europepmc.org) is in XML and most of the output of the analysis program [AMI](http://github.com/petermr/ami3) is also in XML.

## XML background
petermr is giving a tutorial/presentation at [XMLSummerSchool 19](https://xmlsummerschool.com/) and using CEV as the example material. 

## tools fot XML
I currently use Java - first suggested by Jon Bosak in 1997 - and I haven't regretted it. It's a bit verbose by modern standards but it's strongly typed, fail-at-compile
